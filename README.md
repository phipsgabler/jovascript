# Jovascript

A small functional language I'm experimenting with, compiled to Javascript. I plan to experiment with at type system based 
on record types, together with union and intersection types (similar to [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org)). But everything 
is still open...

## Build

```
> cd jovascript
> sbt init
> sbt compile
```
